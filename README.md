## Sudoku Game

This project is the implementation of Sudoku game made using React JS.

### Introduction to Game:

In this game the player is given a 9 X 9 board in which there are few cells already filled with value from 1 to 9. The player has to fill the remaining cells in such a way that every row, every column and every blocks are having all values from 1 to 9 contained in it and appears only once.

### Algorithm Used to Solve Sudoku:

Backtracking Algorithm is used to generate the board as well as to solve the sudoku puzzle. In order to generate the board first an empty sudoku board is solved, then one by one pieces are removed from the cell randomly and then backtracking is done after every removal to ensure that the solution after removal of the cell is still unique.
